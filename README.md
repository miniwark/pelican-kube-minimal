pelican-kube-minimal
====================

A minimalistic featureless [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) theme based on [Kube](http://imperavi.com/kube/) CSS framework.

About
-----
I do not care a lot about, feeds, socials icons, tags, blog archives, sitemap, comments, etc...
I just need text, images, menus and code display.

So this templates will not have all the Pelican features!
